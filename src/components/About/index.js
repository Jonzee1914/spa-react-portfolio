        <p> I currently am a Member Experience Specialist, for a credit union in Central Florida. The ever changing face of the financial industry has motivated
            me to expand my horizons and embark on a path to being a full stack web developer. This portfolio and my bio is a little light right now, but check back in a few months
            when I have even more to say about my skills.

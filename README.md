## Usage 

This is a deployed site, so there is no work needed in order to view the site, simply go to .<br />
<br />
However if you like to use the build yourself you can clone the repo and then from the root of your project directory you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. However you must modify the package.json file to include the homepage property at the top. This is where the website will be deployed. Use your GitHub username in place of the <username> placeholder, as shown in the following statement:

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!<br />

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
